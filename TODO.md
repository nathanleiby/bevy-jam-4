# TODO

## sooner

- [x] add egui inspector
- [x] draw player - from existing
- [x] draw some circles

- [ ] collisions between circles and player (try [xpbd](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd))
- [ ] accrete circles to player
- [ ] player movement
- [ ] add player rotation, so circles accrete all over
- [ ] spawn Goo randomly, on timer
- [ ] allow easily tweaking some gameplay params (fall speed, etc) via Bevy EGUI
