"petri dish"

instead of goo and spaceship, maybe make it cellular-- an amoeba that eats other cells?
this would lead to more interesting art design, and also make it more unique.
it would also give meaning to the many entities, since each cell could be active and moving around

could have a circle around the action, to give the feel of being inside the dish or under a microscope.

challenge: this makes moving in all directions make more sense, vs simple left right and rotation.

goo is nice and abstract.

Gameplay accident: attaching to the wall gives a "floppy spider web" experience.
See screenshot.

Might every cell be independent, but some can overwhelm others?
How to determine who overwhelms?

CHAT GPT weirdness:
Accidents happen in the lab. You are a scientist, and you've accidentally spilled some goo on the floor.
You must clean it up before it gets out of control!
