"petri dish"

instead of goo and spaceship, maybe make it cellular-- an amoeba that eats other cells?
this would lead to more interesting art design, and also make it more unique.
it would also give meaning to the many entities, since each cell could be active and moving around

could have a circle around the action, to give the feel of being inside the dish or under a microscope.

challenge: this makes moving in all directions make more sense, vs simple left right and rotation.

goo is nice and abstract.

Gameplay accident: attaching to the wall gives a "floppy spider web" experience.
See screenshot.

Might every cell be independent, but some can overwhelm others?
How to determine who overwhelms?

CHAT GPT weirdness:
Accidents happen in the lab. You are a scientist, and you've accidentally spilled some goo on the floor.
You must clean it up before it gets out of control!

Player

Goo
GooType::enum = Construction/Destruct, Grow/Shrink, slow/fast

Goo interacts with player - attach or damage
Goo interacts with Goo?

---

Cells

Arena with walls (petri dish)
Goo that divides, mitosis

Entity counter in one corner

--

goo radius corresponds to armor/damage amount? (e.g. hit a big goo with a small goo and it shrinks)
Instead try: many small Goos. Big goo IS many small goos, and numbers could work out.

accident: goo was carrying one of the purple balls - maybe objective is to push / shepherd objects around?
seems fun with the physics. Fixed Joints maybe could be more like webs/nets

would be cool if go had different properties, like sticky, bouncy, etc
so you can wrap around target ball, or fling it more.
maybe interesting physics applies to objects in env, rather than goo? so you could shepherd push a ball into a trampoline to shoot it into the "goal"

idea: temporary buffs, like N seconds of invincibility (plow through destruction orbs!), increased speed, etc

--

some "wind" would be cool to keep the environment a bit more lively.
should spawn purple Goo from various directions to make it more interesting.
periodic "Goo Storm" warning that spawns a bunch of goo in increases the wind?? so you have to make it through that.
